Δ-Framework : a simple PHP Framework

![logo](/images/logo.png)

The purpose of this framework is to give some basic templates and an MVVC architecture compatible with PHP 5.1.3, 
for people that have some knowledge in php development 
and are looking for a simple framework to study and play with.

Warning : this is not a commercial framework and it must not be used in a production environment.

To use it, download and extract it (or git clone it) and set it as a PHP web site.

Start to look at the index.php file, reads the comments, edit the files and build your own components, enjoy :).
